"""
Classes for interacting with the tor control socket.

Controllers are a wrapper around a ControlSocket, retaining many of its methods
(connect, close, is_alive, etc) in addition to providing its own for
interacting at a higher level.

**Module Overview:**

::

  from_port - Provides a Controller based on a port connection.
  from_socket_file - Provides a Controller based on a socket file connection.
  
  Controller - General controller class intended for direct use.
    |- get_info - issues a GETINFO query
    |- get_version - convenience method to get tor version
    |- authenticate - convenience method to authenticate the controller
    |- quit - convenience method to terminate the controller
    +- protocolinfo - convenience method to get the protocol info
  
  BaseController - Base controller class asynchronous message handling.
    |- msg - communicates with the tor process
    |- is_alive - reports if our connection to tor is open or closed
    |- connect - connects or reconnects to tor
    |- close - shuts down our connection to the tor process
    |- get_socket - provides the socket used for control communication
    |- add_status_listener - notifies a callback of changes in our status
    |- remove_status_listener - prevents further notification of status changes
    +- __enter__ / __exit__ - manages socket connection
