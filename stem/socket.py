"""
Supports message based communication with sockets speaking the tor control
protocol. This lets users send messages as basic strings and receive responses
as instances of the ControlMessage class.

ControlSocket - Socket wrapper that speaks the tor control protocol.
  |- ControlPort - Control connection via a port.
  |  |- get_address - provides the ip address of our socket
  |  +- get_port - provides the port of our socket
  |
  |- ControlSocketFile - Control connection via a local file socket.
  |  +- get_socket_path - provides the path of the socket we connect to
  |
  |- send - sends a message to the socket
  |- recv - receives a ControlMessage from the socket
  |- is_alive - reports if the socket is known to be closed
  |- connect - connects a new socket
  +- close - shuts down the socket

ControlMessage - Message that's read from the control socket.
  |- content - provides the parsed message content
  |- raw_content - unparsed socket data
  |- __str__ - content stripped of protocol formatting
  +- __iter__ - ControlLine entries for the content of the message

ControlLine - String subclass with methods for parsing controller responses.
  |- remainder - provides the unparsed content
  |- is_empty - checks if the remaining content is empty
  |- is_next_quoted - checks if the next entry is a quoted value
  |- is_next_mapping - checks if the next entry is a KEY=VALUE mapping
  |- pop - removes and returns the next entry
  +- pop_mapping - removes and returns the next entry as a KEY=VALUE mapping

send_message - Writes a message to a control socket.
recv_message - Reads a ControlMessage from a control socket.
send_formatting - Performs the formatting expected from sent messages.

ControllerError - Base exception raised when using the controller.
  |- ProtocolError - Malformed socket data.
  +- SocketError - Communication with the socket failed.
     +- SocketClosed - Socket has been shut down.
